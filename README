A new scala-mode for emacs.

The current scala-mode with for emacs that comes scala-dist is beyond
repair. It is overly complex and hard to maintain.

This new major mode intends to be simple, yet provide the following:
- indenting
- highlighting
- motion commands

The mode will target scala code written in a functinal style.

Check out Example.scala to see how it indents.

Special thanks for valuable feedback:

TODO:
- indent scaladoc left margin correctly
- indenting a row removes trailing whitespace and converts tabs to spaces
- highlight number (decimal, octal, hex, double, float) literals as constants
- indent and fill multi-line strings with margin correctly
- high-light headings and annotations inside scaladoc specially (use underline for headings)
